Training materials for ARCC hosted boot camps

Advanced Research Computing Center (ARCC)  
University of Wyoming  
https://arcc.uwyo.edu  

**Goal**  
A rapid paced training session which introduces professors, researchers, and students to research computing with Linux,
basic computing architectures, and brief introductons to parallelization techniques. The goal is not to make you an
expert in all of research computing, but to help you take the first steps in getting you started with research computing
and high performance computing.  

We've chosen to use Github because we also want to expose you to the basics of version control as well as make our
materials as easy as possible to access.

**WARNING**: These examples are not all complete and may contain bugs that are intentional for the lab sections. This code
is to show basic examples and for you to work through problems similar to homework. We'll provide comments in the code
which are intentionally incomplete and need additions, however bugs we will **not** note as they are discussion elements for the lab segments during the bootcamp.

Documentation can be found within the repository as well as on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/WyoARCC/bootcamps/wiki)
